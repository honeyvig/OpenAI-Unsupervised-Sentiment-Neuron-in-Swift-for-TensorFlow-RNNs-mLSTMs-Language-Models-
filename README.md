# OpenAI-Unsupervised-Sentiment-Neuron-in-Swift-for-TensorFlow-RNNs-mLSTMs-Language-Models
The Unsupervised Sentiment Neuron is a deep learning model built by OpenAI that detects sentiment in text without using labeled sentiment data. The model leverages unsupervised learning with neural networks to predict sentiment, particularly trained on language models like LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory) and RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks). The model operates without labeled sentiment data, instead learning to predict sentiment based on its interactions with large text corpora.
Steps:

    Understanding the Core Idea: OpenAI's Sentiment Neuron is a simple LSTM model that is unsupervised. The approach uses a language model (a generative model) and learns to predict sentiment from sequences of text.
    Building the Model in Swift for TensorFlow: We’ll create an LSTM model to predict sentiment based on sequences of text. We’ll also simulate an unsupervised learning scenario by training the model on large text data without explicit sentiment labels.

Since Swift for TensorFlow is no longer actively maintained, the following code can be used as an educational reference for how one might approach implementing such models in Swift for TensorFlow.
Basic Structure for Unsupervised Sentiment Neuron in Swift for TensorFlow

The code below sets up an unsupervised sentiment model using RNNs or LSTMs with Swift for TensorFlow. The model will be trained using word embeddings and an LSTM cell to process sequences of text.
Key Components:

    Embedding Layer: Embeds the input text into a vector space.
    LSTM Layer: Processes sequential data and learns the patterns.
    Dense Layer: Outputs sentiment prediction from the final LSTM state.

Swift for TensorFlow Implementation

import TensorFlow
import Foundation

// Define the SentimentModel using LSTM
struct SentimentModel: Layer {
    var embedding: Embedding<Float>
    var lstmCell: LSTMCell<Float>
    var dense: Dense<Float>
    
    init(vocabSize: Int, embeddingDim: Int, hiddenSize: Int) {
        self.embedding = Embedding(vocabularySize: vocabSize, embeddingSize: embeddingDim)
        self.lstmCell = LSTMCell(inputSize: embeddingDim, hiddenSize: hiddenSize)
        self.dense = Dense(inputSize: hiddenSize, outputSize: 1)
    }
    
    @differentiable
    func callAsFunction(_ input: Tensor<Float>) -> Tensor<Float> {
        let embedded = embedding(input) // Apply word embeddings
        
        // Use LSTM to process sequences
        var lstmState = LSTMCell<Float>.State()
        let (output, _) = lstmCell(embedded, state: lstmState)
        
        // Dense layer to make sentiment prediction
        return dense(output)
    }
}

// Preprocess the text into numerical tokens (word indices)
func preprocessText(_ text: [String]) -> Tensor<Float> {
    // Word to index mapping (simple example, normally a pretrained tokenizer would be used)
    let wordToIndex: [String: Int] = ["good": 1, "bad": 2, "happy": 3, "sad": 4]
    
    var sequences = [[Int]]()
    
    for sentence in text {
        let words = sentence.split(separator: " ").map { String($0) }
        let sequence = words.compactMap { wordToIndex[$0] }
        sequences.append(sequence)
    }
    
    // Convert sequences into Tensor
    return Tensor<Float>(sequences)
}

// Training Loop
func trainSentimentModel(model: inout SentimentModel, data: [String], labels: [Int], epochs: Int) {
    let optimizer = Adam(for: model)
    
    for epoch in 1...epochs {
        var totalLoss: Float = 0
        for (i, sentence) in data.enumerated() {
            let input = preprocessText([sentence])
            let label = Tensor<Float>([Float(labels[i])])
            
            let (prediction, grad) = valueWithGradient(at: model) { model -> Tensor<Float> in
                let output = model(input)
                let loss = meanSquaredError(predicted: output, expected: label)
                return loss
            }
            
            optimizer.update(&model, along: grad)
            totalLoss += totalLoss
        }
        
        print("Epoch \(epoch): Loss = \(totalLoss)")
    }
}

// Example data (for simplicity)
let sentences = ["good movie", "bad movie", "happy day", "sad day"]
let sentimentLabels = [1, 0, 1, 0]  // 1 = Positive, 0 = Negative

// Initialize the model
let vocabSize = 10000  // Example vocabulary size
let embeddingDim = 50  // Word embedding size
let hiddenSize = 128  // LSTM hidden size
var model = SentimentModel(vocabSize: vocabSize, embeddingDim: embeddingDim, hiddenSize: hiddenSize)

// Train the model
trainSentimentModel(model: &model, data: sentences, labels: sentimentLabels, epochs: 10)

// Evaluate the model
let testSentence = "good day"
let testInput = preprocessText([testSentence])
let prediction = model(testInput)
print("Sentiment prediction for '\(testSentence)': \(prediction)")

Explanation of the Code:

    SentimentModel: This is a custom Layer in Swift for TensorFlow that implements the entire model:
        Embedding: Converts each word in the input sequence into a vector.
        LSTMCell: Processes the embedded input sequence and learns patterns from it.
        Dense Layer: Outputs a prediction for sentiment (positive or negative).

    Preprocess the Text:
        The preprocessText function simulates tokenizing sentences into integer sequences (you would typically use a sophisticated tokenizer like those found in libraries such as spaCy or Transformers for more complex tasks).
        Here, we map words to integers using a simple dictionary (wordToIndex).

    Training Loop:
        The trainSentimentModel function uses the Adam optimizer to minimize the mean squared error loss function.
        The model is trained on example sentences for a fixed number of epochs (in this case, 10 epochs).

    Evaluation:
        Once the model is trained, we can test it by passing new text through the model and checking the output, which represents the sentiment of the text.

Notes:

    Dataset: This is a simple, illustrative dataset. In real scenarios, you would train the model on a much larger corpus of data.
    Unsupervised Learning: The model here is not purely "unsupervised" like OpenAI's implementation. For true unsupervised learning, you would typically train a model on a large corpus without any labeled sentiment data, using techniques like self-supervised learning or contrastive learning.
    Word Embeddings: In this case, we manually map words to indices, but in practice, you would use pretrained word embeddings like GloVe or Word2Vec for better performance.

Conclusion:

This implementation gives you a starting point for building a sentiment analysis model based on LSTM in Swift for TensorFlow. While this is a simplified version of OpenAI's Sentiment Neuron, it demonstrates the core components needed to set up and train an unsupervised sentiment model using recurrent neural networks. To fully replicate OpenAI’s model, you would need to train on a larger and more complex dataset and apply more advanced techniques such as unsupervised learning strategies and large pre-trained language models.
